## Overview

This project is a hands-free job application agent for students.

It:
•⁠  ⁠Builds a facts-only student artifact pack
•⁠  ⁠Matches and ranks relevant jobs
•⁠  ⁠Generates grounded, job-specific personalization
•⁠  ⁠Automatically submits applications
•⁠  ⁠Tracks success, failures, and retries

No fabricated credentials.  
No uncontrolled automation.

## Core Components

•⁠  ⁠*Artifact Pack Generator (⁠ /analyze ⁠)*  
  Resume, GitHub, LinkedIn, and portfolio ingestion into a single source of truth.

•⁠  ⁠*Job Matching & Ranking (⁠ /match-jobs-ai ⁠)*  
  AI-based semantic matching, skill overlap scoring, and automatable job filtering.

•⁠  ⁠*Auto-Personalization (⁠ /generate-short-notes-from-queue ⁠)*  
  Recruiter notes grounded strictly in student evidence.

•⁠  ⁠*Sandbox Auto-Apply (⁠ /sandbox-apply-batch ⁠)*  
  Fully autonomous submission with safety gates and outcome tracking.

## Safety & Autonomy

•⁠  ⁠⁠ automation_allowed ⁠ hard gate  
•⁠  ⁠Match score thresholds  
•⁠  ⁠Grounded personalization only  
•⁠  ⁠Failure handling and retries  

Autonomy is enforced in code, not prompts.
